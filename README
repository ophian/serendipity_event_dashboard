* The Serendipity Dashboard [Proof of Concept] for version ?.

* This is Beta status, as long as there won't be some more testers!

* Please test the functions and the general behaviour. Live with it for a while.

* Do not mind the colours. They are customizable via CSS.

* The CSS has not yet been cleaned-up.

* Some functions (i.e. help screens) are not ready and still a work in progress!

* The current help screen is my development gazette, noting ideas and fixed issues to this P.o.C.

* This Dashboard-Concept is strictly based to the default Backend as used in /templates/default/admin/* and /templates/bulletproof/admin/*.

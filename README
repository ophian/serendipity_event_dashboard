===

## Name: serendipity_event_dashboard

* The Serendipity Dashboard [Proof of Concept] for S9y version <= 1.6.x.
  PLEASE NOTE: This branch 1.6 holds the current state for Serendipity versions < 1.7! It will only get bugfixes.

* Although running stable enough as is, this plugin is still announced to have testing status, as long as there won't be some more testers and feedback!

* Please test the functions and the general behaviour. Live with it for a while.

* Do not mind the colours. They are customizable via CSS.

* Some minor functions (i.e. help screens) are not ready and still a work in progress!

* The current help screen is my development gazette, noting ideas and fixed issues to this P.o.C.

* This Dashboard-Concept is strictly based to the default Backend as used in /templates/default/admin/* and /templates/bulletproof/admin/*.

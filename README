v.2.0.2 | 2012-12-12 | Branch 2.0
===

## Name: serendipity_event_dashboard

* The Serendipity Dashboard [Proof of Concept] for S9y version 2.0
  PLEASE NOTE: This version 2.x branch will **only** work with a current Serendipity **2.0** dev!

* Although running stable enough as is, this plugin is still announced to have testing status, as long as there won't be some more testers and feedback!

* Please test the functions and the general behaviour. Live with it for a while.

* Do not mind the colours. They are customizable via CSS.

* Some minor functions (i.e. help screens) are not ready and still a work in progress!

* The current help screen is my development gazette, noting ideas and fixed issues to this P.o.C.

* This Dashboard-Concept is strictly based to the new backend files as used in /templates/2k11/admin/* and some in default.

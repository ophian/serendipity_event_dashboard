        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>The</u> Dashboard itself has 3 main parts, which are the <strong>header</strong> and two <strong>meta-boxes</strong>, one to the left, the other to the right. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>If</u> you hover around with your mouse, you will notice a fine <strong>dashed border</strong> appear arround a slightly changed background color, which marks the height and width of these meta boxes. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Inside</u> these meta-boxes, the Dashboard uses <strong>draggable content boxes</strong> (like general info, pending comments, draft entries, etc).  </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>If</u> you click an elements boxed title bar, partly <strong>every</strong> place of an element box, where there is no text and is left blank, the box itself will get <strong>marked</strong> with a highlighted golden background. 
            Another <strong>click</strong> will right undo it, if you accidently or by fun clicked the highlight event element box.
            You can <strong>drag</strong> this element to the other metabox and <strong>drop</strong> it there. 
            If you highlight several elements of the same metabox and drag one of them, they will all follow into the <strong>dropzone</strong> and append to the very end.
            This drop <strong>triggers</strong> a cookie and page <strong>event</strong> to <strong>hold</strong> you settings until next change. 
            To <strong>sort</strong> content elements of the <u>same</u> meta-box, just drag and drop them to <strong>itself</strong>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Now</u>, each content-box has the flip-capability to show or hide its content by clicking the small <strong>triangle arrow</strong> on the right of the boxed title bar. 
            This triggers another event to also be kept and remembered by <strong>cookie</strong>. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>So</u>, when you <strong>return</strong> to your start page (the dashboard screen), it will reload the last state of opened or closed content boxes, as well as which was dropped into the meta box zone.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Some</u> content element boxes, like comments, have another icons to <strong>show<span class="icon-plus"></span> or hide<span class="icon-minus"></span></strong> some additional content features and even some provide a zoom <span class="icon-zoom-in"></span> icon, to show truncated content. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>In</u> case you do not want to work with modal containers, push the big blue <strong>sliding</strong> button to show the sidebar. In this mode, backend links open as they did in old backend mode before.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>And</u>, btw., the <strong>state</strong> of the sidebar push button will be remembered, as we have seen for the drag&drop boxes and the boxbar-flip event, too.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>In</u> case you need to <strong>configure</strong> these or other settings by default, you have to click to the dashboard config button <span class="icon-cog"></span>, which is in the upper blue header.<!-- and looks like a single <strong>cogwheel</strong>. -->
            This opens the plugins configuration where you can finetune the default settings of this plugin.</p>
        <p><strong>Have fun!</strong></p>

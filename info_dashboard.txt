 As of changing the $serendipity['templatePath'] and $serendipity['template'] on demand, 
 in case of containerized backend views into the dashboard plugin path, we needed to clone
 
 - the complete /templates/default/admin directory, 
 - hold staticpage template file in dashboard /backend_templates (are there more to include?)
 - and also pass some images and scripts residing in /templates/default or /templates/default/img 
 - to also live in the dashboard path, while called as {serendipity_getFile file="img/plus.png"} 
 - or {serendipity_getFile file="dragdrop.js"} for examples, which get called in core scripts like 
 - /include/admin/tpl/plugins.inc.tpl and /include/functions_plugins_admin.inc.php, or in some of the cloned tpl files.
 
 To not get lost having too many files, the new on-demand path will now be: /plugins/serendipity_event_dashboard/default/.
 
Still buggy and unresolved issues in **modal container** view:

- the drag and drop javascript fails to work (in plugins overview page and the dashboard config view)
- the upload of media files fails to work (the fields javascript now gathered in serendipity_editor.js vs serendipity[userfile][] collection is missing?)
- some redirects do not happen how they should to be
